Courtship related analyses & raw data only. 

Regarding RScript:
- Used original RSCript from Dropbox > UG UROPS Pamela Kuan > POST UROPS SAVE ME >Manuscript > R Scripts . MeanÂ±SE plots were previously chosen, so removed CI codes to avoid confusion

Regarding .csv files:
- Slight difference between raw data files: "courtship_combinedCSV.csv" vs "new_modeling_courtship.csv"
   - "courtship_combinedCSV.csv" has Parental generation  duplicated in both relaxed selection (RS) and selection (S)  treatment groups for plotting purposes
