# Sepsid_NL_Predation

This repo is created by Lee Li Ying Nicole (RA from 2019-2024) on behalf of Pamela Kuan, UG UROPS student from AY2017/18, who worked on the UROPS project: Effects of Predation on Male Reproductive Trait Evolution in *Sepsis punctum*.

The repo has been made public as the work has been published under: Lee NLY, Kuan PSY, Hua HQH, Puniamoorthy N. 2024. Experimental evolution under predation reduces body size in dung flies but courtship displays persist in males (Diptera: Sepsidae). Behavioural Processes. 220: 105073.
