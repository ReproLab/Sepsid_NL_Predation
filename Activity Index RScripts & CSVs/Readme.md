Activity related analyses & raw data only.
! Overall activity did not differ significantly (ANOVA: F=0.829, df=2, p=0.467; Supplementary Material 1: Fig. S2). Thus, this measure was removed from subsequent behavioural analyses.

Regarding RScript:
Used original RScript from Dropbox > UG UROPS Pamela Kuan > POST UROPS SAVE ME >Manuscript > R Scripts. Added shapiro's test for normality & ANOVA test (since normal distribution) for significant differences. MeanÂ±SE plots were previously chosen, so removed CI codes to avoid confusion
